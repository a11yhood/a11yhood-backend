# a11yhood Environment Modes Guide

We operate three environments, separated by env files and database backends:

- Dev/Test (local, SQLite, seeded): `.env.test`, SQLite at `/tmp/a11yhood-test.db`, seeded fixtures, mock users, safe to reset.
- Production (local, Supabase): `.env`, connects to Supabase, real OAuth, no seeding.
- Deploy (external host, Supabase): same as Production but running on the external server; `.env` holds the production Supabase and OAuth secrets, no seeding.

`ENV_FILE` selects the mode used by [config.py](config.py):

```bash
ENV_FILE=.env.test  # Dev/Test
ENV_FILE=.env       # Production/Deploy
```

## Dev/Test (Local SQLite + Seeds)

Setup
```bash
cp .env.test.example .env.test  # if missing
```

Start Dev/Test
```bash
./start-dev.sh --seed
```

What happens
- Exports `ENV_FILE=.env.test`
- Uses SQLite at `/tmp/a11yhood-test.db`
- Runs `seed_scripts/seed_all.py` (test users/products/collections, search terms)
- Disables real OAuth (uses mock/test users)

Running tests
```bash
./run-tests.sh
```
Tests always set `ENV_FILE=.env.test` and use the same SQLite DB.

Stop
```bash
./stop-dev.sh
```

## Production (Local with Supabase)

Setup
```bash
cp .env.test.example .env  # if missing
```
Fill `.env` with Supabase and OAuth secrets. See [DEPLOYMENT_PLAN.md](documentation/DEPLOYMENT_PLAN.md) and [AGENT_GUIDE.md](documentation/AGENT_GUIDE.md) for required values.

Start Production
```bash
./start-prod.sh
```
Uses `ENV_FILE=.env`, connects to Supabase, and does not seed.

Verify
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/health
curl http://localhost:8000/api/sources/supported
```

Stop
```bash
./stop-prod.sh
```

## Deploy (External Host with Supabase)

- Same settings as Production but running on the external server.
- Ensure `.env` on the host points to the production Supabase project and real OAuth secrets.
- Do **not** seed in this environment.

## Switching Between Modes

Dev/Test → Production
```bash
./stop-dev.sh
./start-prod.sh
```

Production → Dev/Test
```bash
./stop-prod.sh
./start-dev.sh --seed
```

## Safety Checks

- Confirm the active env: `echo $ENV_FILE` (`.env.test` for Dev/Test, `.env` for Production/Deploy).
- Dev/Test leaves a local file at `/tmp/a11yhood-test.db`; Production/Deploy do not.
- If seeding fails in Dev/Test, rerun `./start-dev.sh --seed` after ensuring `.env.test` exists.
